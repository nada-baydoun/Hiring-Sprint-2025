# 🚗 AI-Powered Vehicle Condition Assessment — Hiring Sprint

## 🧩 Overview

Build a working prototype for **AI-powered vehicle condition assessment**. The system should allow users to capture/upload vehicle images at pick-up and return, automatically detect damages, and display a report.

The solution can be a **web** or **mobile** app. Use of pretrained AI/ML models or APIs is allowed.

## 🎯 Goal / Business Requirements

**Business Goal:** Automate and simplify vehicle condition inspections for rental businesses (cars, scooters, boats, equipment). Enable customers and staff to:

- Capture/upload vehicle images at pick-up and return
- Detect and compare damages between pick-up and return
- Estimate severity and cost of damages
- Display results in a dashboard or report
- Integrate with 3rd party systems via API

**Example Workflow:**

1. Customer picks up a car, takes photos via the app.
2. On return, new photos are taken.
3. The system compares images, highlights new damages, and estimates repair costs.
4. A summary report is shown in the UI and available via API.

## ☁️ Deployment Requirements

- For webapp, you are free to deploy anywhere: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), etc.
- For mobile apps, if cloud deployment is not possible, share the APK or Expo link

---

## 💎 Bonus Points

- Testing: Automated tests + instructions to run them
- Documentation: API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI/GraphQL)
- CI/CD: Pipeline for automated deployment
- Dockerfile

## 🛠️ Resources

### Deployment Free Resources

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — Web frontend
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) — Web frontend
- [Render](https://render.com/) — Web or backend
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) — Backend containers
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) — React Native mobile apps

### AI Models / LLMS

- You are free to use any free/open-source models, libraries, or APIs.
- You may host your own solution or use a publicly available API, whatever works best for your prototype.
- The goal is a working, reproducible prototype. Accuracy and cleverness will be evaluated, but you don’t need a production-level solution.

---

## 📝 Pro Tips / Implementation Notes

- Focus first on business requirements and core functionality. A working prototype is better than a fancy but incomplete solution.
- You can store images however it makes sense (in memory, temp files, cloud storage, etc.)
- Show results clearly in the UI: side-by-side images, highlights, and summary reports.
- Prioritize clean, modular code and reproducibility for easy evaluation.
- You may combine multiple tools to detect, score, and summarize damages.
